# **CommitVault**

## Intention-Driven DeFi

### Plan. Commit. Prosper.

## The DeFi Dilemma: Impulsive Actions

The speed of DeFi is a double-edged sword.

Easy access to capital + market volatility often leads to:

- Emotional Trading (FOMO, FUD)
- Lack of Planning & Strategy
- Regrettable Financial Decisions

---

## **Problem:**

Most DeFi tools focus on _execution speed_

Not _user psychology_ or _decision quality_.

## The Solution: CommitVault

**CommitVault introduces a "behavioral gating layer" to your DeFi capital.**

It forces a pause for **intentionality** by requiring users to:

1. **Commit On-Chain:** Lock funds until you have clear investment plan.
2. **Define an Investment Plan:** Articulate your strategy.
3. **Unlock Strategically:** Accessible only after you have a good plan.

## How

**Core Loop:** Deposit -> Plan -> Commit Plan -> Unlock -> Withdraw

- **Vault Creation:** Secure, personal on-chain vaults (PDAs).
- **Unlock Strategies:**
  - **Solo Mode:** Time-based cooldown after plan submission.
  - **Mentor Mode:** Requires approval from a chosen mentor.
- **SPL Token Support:** Deposit & withdraw standard Solana tokens (e.g., USDC).
- **Secure & Transparent:** Built on Solana, leveraging its speed and security.
